This is a self start project. This repository contains code, data and resources used to implement a data pipeline. The thrust of this pipeline is to extract property data from Zoopla (using the RapidAPI REST API), stage the extracted raw data into a folder in an Amazon S3 bucket, transform the data thereafter, then finally load the transformed data into Amazon RedShift.
